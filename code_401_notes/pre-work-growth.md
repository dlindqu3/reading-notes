- we should deliberately practice mainly those parts of skill that are difficult 
- we should use small, well-defined challenges that build upon each other and lead towards mastery of various skills

- it's important to have a growth mindset 
- the challenge of learning a tricky problem helps the knowledge stick
- praise perseverence, not intelligence  

#### source: "Grit: the power of passion and perseverence", Angel Lee Duckworth, [link](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance) 

- many high-scoring students have high levels of grit, not necessarily IQ 

### source: "A kinder, gentler philosophy of success", Alain de Botton, [link](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

- the speaker believes that you can't be successful at everything 
- we should make sure that our conception of success is not overly affected by outside forces
