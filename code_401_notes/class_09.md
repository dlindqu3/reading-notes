####  source: Bob Belderbos, "Enriching Your Python Classes With Dunder (Magic, Special) Methods" [link](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)
  - dunder methods let you imitate the behavior of built-in types
  - __repr__ - string representation for developers 
  - __str__ - string representation for end user 
  - str is what results from a print(classInstance)
  - __len__ - imitates string length 


####  source: Christian Pascual, "Tutorial: Basic Statistics in Python â€” Probability" [link](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/basic-statistics-in-python-probability/)
  - probability:  occurence/sample space 
  - a normal distribution is a probability distribution that is symmetric around the mean 
  -  Central Limit Theorem: the distribution of multiple sample distributions is a normal distribution around the real population mean 
  - Given a normal distribution, 68% of data will fall within one standard deviation of the mean 
  - z score: distance from mean of a point, measured by standard deviation 

####  source: "Intro to Statistics" [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdHtK7CWpCQ)
  - important measures: mean, median, IQR
  - probability distributions can help us see the spread of data and the chance that a certain event will occur 
  - bayesian statistics: conditional probability 
      - P(A | B) = P(B | A) P(A) / P(B)

  - Siraj R. messed up and cheated people out of a payed course
  - Siraj also stole peoples' code
