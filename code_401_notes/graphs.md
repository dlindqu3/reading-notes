# Code 401 Reading Notes 
### 35. Graphs 

####  source: "Graphs" [link](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)
- collection of vertices/nodes connected by edges 
- a vertex is a data object that can have 0 or more adjacent vertices 
- an edge is a connection between nodes 
- neighbors - adjacent nodes 
- degree - the degree of a vertex is its number of edges 
- graphs can be directed or undirected 
- graphs can also be complete, connected, or disconnected 
- graphs can be acyclic or cyclic 
- graphs are typically represented as an adjacency matrix or list 
- a weighted graph has numbers on edges 
- traversal - breadth, depth
