# Code 401 Reading Notes 
### 15. Read: 15 -  Trees  

####  source: "Trees" [link](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/Trees.html)
- 3 types: binary trees, binary search trees, and k-ary trees 
- common terms:
  - node: value and reference 
  - root: first node 
  - K: max number of children for a node 
  - left, right: child nodes in binary trees 
  - edge: the link between a parent and child node 
  - leaf: node with no children 
  - height: number of edges from root to furthest leaf 
- types of traversal: 
  - depth first 
  - breadth first 
- types of depth first: 
  - pre-order, in-order, post-order 
- it is common to traverse with recursion 
- breadth first goes level by level 
- traversing a k-ary tree requires the same approach as a breadth first traversal
