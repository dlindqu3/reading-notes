1. I agree that pain/cost in the service of a goal is worthwhile 
2. I'm doing this to become a proficient software developer 
3. Yes. 
4. Yes.

- software engineers use Big O to show the complexity or performance of an algorithm 
- common Big O values: O(1), O(N), O(N^2), O(2^N), O(logN)
- the best values for Big O are O(1) or O(N)
- binary search techniques often have a relatively efficent Big O of logN 


#### Things I want to know more about 
- I need to review more specifics on how to determine the Big O of a given algorithm
