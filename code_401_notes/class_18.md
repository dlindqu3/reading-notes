### 18. Cryptopgraphy

- 3 main methods to solve cyphers - frequency analysis, known plaintext, and brute force
- frequency analysis takes account of common letters, like "e" 
- brute force - for an english alphabet, there are only 25 possible shifts 


####  source: "Caesar cipher" [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
- Caesar would encrypt messages by shifting letters down the alphabet by 3 
- compared to modern techniques, this is relatively simple 

####  source: "Cryptography: Crash Course Computer Science #33" [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXCTbFnK8o)
- the caesar cypher is an example of a substitution cypher
- one relatively strong cypher technique today is AES, which chops data then substitutes/permutates the data
- key exchange lets two computers agree on a key without ever sending one, by using one-way functions

#### Things I want to know more about 
-  when encryption needs to be used
