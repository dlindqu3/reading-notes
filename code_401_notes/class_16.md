# Code 401 Reading Notes 
### 16. Read: 16 - Serverless Functions 

####  source: "What is serverless computing?" [link](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless)
- serverless is a cloud computing execution model 
  - it automatically scales to demand 
- the servers are invisible to the customer, thus the name
- core techs in cloud-native apps: 
  1. serverless 
  2. microservices 
  3. containers 
- function as a service (FaaS) is a subset of serverless
  - FaaS is the paradigm in which code/containers only run in response to events or requests

- the serverless stack: 
  1. FaaS
  2. Serverless databases and storage 
  3. event streaming and messaging (such as via Apache Kafka)
  4. API gateways 

####  source: "What is serverless" [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxJobGtqKVM)
- hosting servers is outsourced to the cloud
- containerize dependencies
- FAAS runs functions when events are triggered

#### Things I want to know more about 
- How does Kubernetes simplify containers?
