Chapter 10 (243-292): error handling & debugging 
```

**Chapter 10: error handling and debugging**  
- order of execution 
- execution context 
- call stack: last in, first out 
- hoisting: you can call functions before the have been declared and access variables before they have been declared 
- if a JS statement generates an error, it throws an "exception"
- it then looks for code to handle the exception 
- try, catch, throw, finally
