# Code 301 Reading Notes 
### 11. Read: 11 -  Mongo and Mongoose  

####  source: Luke P. Issac, "SQL vs NoSQL Database Difference Explained with few Example DB" [link](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

## Five differences between SQL and noSQL databases
1.  SQL databases are primarily called relational databases
2. SQL databases are table-based, NoSQL are document-based
3. SQL databases have pre-defined schema, NoSQL have dynamic schema that suits unstructured data
4. SQL databases do not suit hierarchical data, NoSQL suit hierarchical data, or large datasets 
5. SQL databases suit high-transaction applications, NoSQL does not suit high-transaction applications 

## questions 
1. sql databases suit non-hierarchical, structured data
2. for example, sql would suit data on revenue/profit/costs for a company 
3. noSQL suits non-hierarchical or large datasets 
4. many iterations of one similar type of info, such as product info 
5. NoSQL suits hierarchical data 
6. NoSQL are better for scalability

1. structured query language 
2. a relational database uses tables, and these tables connect to others
3. the structure of a relational database is tables 
4. a schema is a group of requirements determining what can go in a table 
5. a NoSQL database is composed of collections and documents, all with potentially varying schema 
6. a NoSQL database works by querying collections and documents 
7. Inside of a Mongo database are collections and documents 
8. NoSQL are more flexible because they do not have strict schema 
9. to expand these databases, you must improve computer hardware, which faces limits 



## Things I want to learn more about: 
- what did Luke P. Isaac mean by "high-transaction" applications, which suit SQL?
