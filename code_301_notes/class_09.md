# Code 301 Reading Notes 
### 9. Read: 09 - Functional Programming 

####  source: TK, "Concepts of Functional Programming in JavaScript" [link](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

1. functional programming divides parts of software into functions as opposed to classes etc. 
2. A pure function always gives the same return value with constant input, and leads to no side-effects. 
3. Benefits of a pure function - they keep the code simple. They are independent of greater state, so they are less prone to errors that cascade through state.
4. Immutability - an object's state cannot be changed after creation. 
5. Referential transparency - a program is referentially transparent if you can replace it with its return value without changing the overall program. 

#### source: The Net Ninja, "Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and Require()" [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k) 

1. A module is a separate, isolated set of code with a particular functionality that can be used in your code. 
2. The word require() allows you to bring functions from one module to another. 
3. Use require and set the value equal to a variable. 
4. module.exports = counter; /// var counter = require('./count'); 

## Things I want to learn more about: 
- Is there different syntax for transfering react-based modules?
