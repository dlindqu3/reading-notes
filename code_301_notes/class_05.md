**Thinking in React**  
- 1. single responsibility principle: a component should only do one thing
- 2. a static version is a version without interactivity 
- 3. make it interactive with JS 
- 4. Is it passed in from a parent via props? Does it remain unchanged over time?Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component?
- 5. the initial location of a state should be a common owner component over all components that need that state.

#### Higher Order Functions 
#### source: "Higher Order Functions" [link](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)
- 1. this is a function that acts on other functions, by returning them or taking them as objects
- 2. line two tests to see if m is greater than n 
- 3. map takes an array and a callback, and runs the callback over the given array, returning each value as it changes. You can then push those new values into an empty array and return it.
